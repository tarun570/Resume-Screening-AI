# 🚀 Built an AI Workflow That Reads & Scores Resumes Automatically

Today I built a workflow that allows you to upload a resume, and the system automatically:

Extracts the resume text

Sends it to an AI model

Generates a score

Applies evaluation rules

Sends the result forward for decision-making

🧠 How it works

- 1️⃣ Upload Resume (PDF/Text)
2️⃣ 📄 Extract text into structured JSON
3️⃣ 🤖 AI (OpenAI) analyzes skills & experience
4️⃣ 🏆 LLM generates scoring output
5️⃣ ✏️ Score is formatted & categorized
6️⃣ 🔁 Conditional logic checks score
7️⃣ ➡️ Pass / Fail branch execution

🎯 Use Cases

Resume screening

Candidate shortlisting

Automated HR filters

Skill gap detection

Bulk resume evaluation

💡 Why this matters

This workflow removes manual resume screening, saves time, reduces bias, and automates the first step of hiring.
